# Ruby attr_accessor Type Flexibility and Potential Bugs

This example demonstrates a subtle but important aspect of Ruby's `attr_accessor` method: it does not enforce type checking on instance variables. While this flexibility is often advantageous, it can also lead to unexpected behavior or bugs if the type of the instance variable is critical to the correctness of your program.

The `bug.rb` file shows how the type of a variable managed by `attr_accessor` can change dynamically, potentially causing silent failures or difficult-to-debug issues. The `bugSolution.rb` file offers a more robust approach.
